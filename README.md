# Books Files

These are the markup / function files for generating the Life Group books from
NLC's LG Application.

Group information provided from data created by using the [Pods
Plugin](http://pods.io).

This plugin allowed for bi-directional relationships between content.

## Why were these made?

NLC used to use Microsoft Word to format all of their LG books. It was
a nightmare.

I was able to pull all the LG data from the database and generate these books
with HTML/CSS - so that all you need to do is print front/back and fold in
half.

## Disclaimer

We had limited timeline and limited resources, so...
the code is kinda dirty, but it works!

## Examples
- You can see a static example here: [nathanielwatts.com/books.html](http://nathanielwatts.com/books/html) (print landscape w/out head/footers)
- And the PDF:
  [nathanielwatts.com/lifegroups.newlifechurch.pdf](http://nathanielwatts.com/lifegroups.newlifechurch.pdf)
- *PLEASE NOTE* Page sorting is "book sorted", so viewing them in a PDF format
  doesn't do the sorting justice (in fact, it looks incredibly out of order
  unless printed & folded).
